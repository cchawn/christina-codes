originally prestended this version of the slides! 💖</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Have you ever had thoughts like "I should know how to do this" or "I shouldn't
share that with my team; it will make me look like I don't deserve to be here"?</p>
<p>The idea of asking questions, admitting when you don't know something, or
sharing when you're struggling might make you uncomfortable, it certainly has
for me. But the vulnerability you demonstrate by doing these things is precisely
what makes a great leader.</p>
<p>There is a fear that vulnerability will be seen as weakness, when it's actually
the root of building authentic and meaningful connections. Once you can push
past the discomfort, being vulnerable at work opens the door to creativity,
innovation, and trust with your team.</p>
<p>In this talk, I share my personal journey with vulnerability, as I learned to
reframe my discomfort as opportunities for growth and eventually find the
courage to be vulnerable.</p>
<h2>Slides</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-1.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 1"></p>
<p>As leaders in engineering, we all share some common goals. We want to focus on
high-impact work and build the trust and influence required to get it done. We
want people to feel comfortable coming to us with their problems and ideas,
asking questions, and sharing their honest opinions.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-2.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 1"></p>
<p>And ultimately, we want our teams to be happy and <em>insert your OKR here</em>.</p>
<p>That sounds all well and good, but realistically, so many things get in the way
and make it harder for us to accomplish our goals.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-3.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 3"></p>
<p>Maybe you've noticed that your team doesn't ask for help. Or recognized that it
takes a long time for concerns to be raised if they’re even brought up at all.
Or maybe you've been told that other developers find you intimidating, and they
don’t feel like they can disagree with you.</p>
<p>What all these things point to is a lack of trust and psychological safety. We
can’t accomplish our goals without creating a psychologically safe space for our
teams.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-4.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 4"></p>
<p><a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/">Extensive research</a>
shows how psychological safety — team members feeling safe enough to take risks
and be vulnerable in front of each other — is the most important dynamic that
sets high-performing teams apart.</p>
<p>Okay. So now, you might be looking at me and thinking — hey Christina, I'm just
one person; how can I actually do anything about this?</p>
<p>And I get it. It's easy to brush off these problems and dismiss them as
organizational or cultural issues that are too hard to fix alone. But as leaders
and role models, we have the power and privilege to create the environment and
culture we want.</p>
<p>So, how do we do that? How do we create an environment where our teams feel
safe? As you've probably guessed, we need to lead by example and lead with
vulnerability.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-5.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 5"></p>
<p>If your initial reaction to hearing that is, "oh wow, absolutely no," you're not
alone. Vulnerability in the workplace can make us feel uncomfortable, like we’re
letting our guard down.</p>
<p>I had been taught and believed that I always needed to be professional. I needed
to maintain my distance and always project a confident and composed image;
otherwise, people wouldn't take me seriously.</p>
<p>I was so afraid to show any vulnerability that whenever I was starting to feel a
little bit vulnerable, I also felt immense shame, like I was letting my image
slip and that people would "find out" about the real me. This fear and shame
crept up whenever I started something new, needed to ask a question, made a
mistake, or struggled to balance work and my personal life. I didn't see other
people openly talk about these things, so I believed that if I did it myself, I
would be seen as weak or like I didn't deserve to be here.</p>
<p>In my mind, being vulnerable would undermine my efforts to be respected, relied
on, and trusted. So I kept my guard up instead.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-6.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 6"></p>
<p>For me, this looked like forcing myself to give 110% at work every single day —
no matter what was going on in my personal life, never making a mistake — and
beating myself up if I ever did, and spending so much time figuring things out
on my own — instead of asking for help. In short, I was avoiding being
vulnerable at all costs.</p>
<p>But what I was actually doing was limiting the connections and trust I could
build with my team, and with the effort required to hide from feeling
vulnerable, I was also running myself straight toward burnout. Eventually, I
realized something needed to change.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-7.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 7"></p>
<p>Around this time, I came across Dr. Brené Brown, and her amazing TED Talk about
the
<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability/c">Power of Vulnerability</a>
(if you haven't watched it yet I recommend that you do!). After watching that, I
read her book Daring Greatly. And what she had to say fundamentally changed the
way that I think about vulnerability.</p>
<p>Brené Brown defines vulnerability as "uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure."
Which I thought, great! That totally aligns with my views.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-8.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 8"></p>
<p>But she also says, "vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy,
courage, empathy, and creativity," and that it's the root of building authentic
and meaningful connections. Now that didn't quite fit.</p>
<p>We'll skip ahead a bit here, but with a lot of reflection, reading, and let's be
honest here — therapy. I learned that you can't avoid ever feeling vulnerable,
without shutting yourself out from all the great things vulnerability opens the
doors to.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-9.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 9"></p>
<p>Now, just because we know that being vulnerable is "good for you" doesn't mean
that the feeling of discomfort immediately disappears. It takes a lot of effort
and practice to sit with that discomfort and work through it.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-10.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 10"></p>
<p>Something that has helped me is to reframe my anxiety and nerves as excitement
and an indication that whatever I'm nervous about is an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>For example. Speaking in front of a large, live audience? That could be pretty
nerve-wracking, but the body sensations of anxiety and nervousness align pretty
closely with how it feels to be excited about something.</p>
<p>So, here I am, being vulnerable and really excited to be speaking in front of
all of you!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-11.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 11"></p>
<p>There's a common misconception about vulnerability — we think that to be
vulnerable, we need to disclose absolutely everything, divulge every aspect of
our personal lives, and lay everything out on the table. But that's not true.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-12.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 12"></p>
<p>Vulnerability without boundaries is simply not vulnerability.</p>
<p>Let’s use a theoretical example. Say you’re a senior leader, and your team is
coming to you expressing concerns about the stability of the tech industry.
Sounds familiar.</p>
<p>So imagine you say: “I’m going to be vulnerable. I’m freaking out. I’ve never
experienced a downturn like this and I’m scared we’re all going to get
laid-off.”</p>
<p>So while your feelings are valid — saying it like that is unfair and likely
going to scare your team. If you genuinely do feel that way, you should
absolutely share it with someone — but probably not the people that are looking
to you as a source of stability and guidance.</p>
<p>Instead you can say: “Your concerns are totally valid, and I feel a similar way.
I’ve never been through something like this before. If you’re feeling
overwhelmed I’m happy to talk more one on one.”</p>
<p>Vulnerability is not about oversharing or dumping your feelings on someone. We
have to think about why we’re sharing and, equally as important, with whom. Ask
yourself: Is this sharing appropriate, and will it move your work, connection or
relationship forward? Or is it just going to make you feel better in the
short-term?</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-13.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 13"></p>
<p>So hopefully, I've convinced you, and you're ready to go forth and practice
vulnerability. I'll share some strategies and tips to get you started.</p>
<p>I tried to come up with a nice acronym, but the best I have for you is this…</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-14.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 14"></p>
<p>ASDF</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-15.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 15"></p>
<p><strong>Admit</strong> what you don't know.</p>
<p>If you pretend like you know everything, you're closing the door to curiosity
and continuous learning and signalling to your team that perfection is expected.
Being vulnerable means we ask questions when we don't know something, we ask for
help when we need it, we say no when something doesn’t fit with our time,
energy, or values, we ask for and listen to feedback, and we don't blame people
when a mistake is made.</p>
<p>Say your team uses an acronym all the time. In theory you know what it means,
but you don’t actually know what the acronym stands for. You can go on
continuing to not know, or you can ask, what does “DAG” stand for? Turns out a
couple people on your team also didn’t know what it stood for, and didn’t feel
comfortable enough to ask. It stands for Directed Acyclic Graph by the way. You
asking what it means, normalizes asking questions and creates the space for
others on your team to do the same.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-16.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 16"></p>
<p><strong>Share</strong> when you are struggling.</p>
<p>It's okay to talk to people about things you're struggling with, whether it’s a
specific project, a personal issue, or something else. It's important to be
honest about what you're going through, and like I already mentioned, you can do
this while respecting your boundaries and not disclosing every detail.</p>
<p>For example, you have something happening in your personal life that’s making it
difficult for you to focus. Instead of suffering in silence and having it
negatively impact your work, you can have the courage to be vulnerable and talk
to your team and say “hey, I’ve got something going on in my life that I’m
struggling with and I wanted you to know. I’ll check in with you if I need help,
but I may need to take some time off.”</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-17.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 17"></p>
<p><strong>Develop</strong> an awareness of how vulnerability feels.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to really feel your emotions and check in with yourself.
Eventually, you'll become more comfortable with vulnerability and more easily
recognize how it feels.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-18.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 18"></p>
<p><strong>Find a friend</strong> to practice with.</p>
<p>Being vulnerable can be intimidating, so the best advice I can give you is to
practice vulnerability with someone you already trust. This could be your
manager, a mentor, a peer or a friend. We need to trust to be vulnerable, and we
need to be vulnerable to build trust. Often it feels like a leap of faith, being
the first to be vulnerable. But the more you practice vulnerability, the more
comfortable you will become with it.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-19.jpeg" alt="Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 19"></p>
<p>I’d like to leave you with this quote by Brené Brown (she’s the best!)</p>
<p>"Trust is earned, not through heroic deeds, or even highly visible actions, but
through paying attention, listening, and gestures of genuine care and
connection."</p>
<p>As leaders, showing that you can be vulnerable at work gives others the
permission to open up and be vulnerable too, ultimately creating a
psychologically safer space for our teams. If we want to foster healthy debate,
for people to share their ideas, seek feedback, and ask for help, we need to
lead by example and lead with vulnerability.</p>

But as leaders\nand role models, we have the power and privilege to create the environment and\nculture we want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, how do we do that? How do we create an environment where our teams feel\nsafe? As you've probably guessed, we need to lead by example and lead with\nvulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-5.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 5\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf your initial reaction to hearing that is, \"oh wow, absolutely no,\" you're not\nalone. Vulnerability in the workplace can make us feel uncomfortable, like we’re\nletting our guard down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been taught and believed that I always needed to be professional. I needed\nto maintain my distance and always project a confident and composed image;\notherwise, people wouldn't take me seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so afraid to show any vulnerability that whenever I was starting to feel a\nlittle bit vulnerable, I also felt immense shame, like I was letting my image\nslip and that people would \"find out\" about the real me. This fear and shame\ncrept up whenever I started something new, needed to ask a question, made a\nmistake, or struggled to balance work and my personal life. I didn't see other\npeople openly talk about these things, so I believed that if I did it myself, I\nwould be seen as weak or like I didn't deserve to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my mind, being vulnerable would undermine my efforts to be respected, relied\non, and trusted. So I kept my guard up instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-6.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 6\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, this looked like forcing myself to give 110% at work every single day —\nno matter what was going on in my personal life, never making a mistake — and\nbeating myself up if I ever did, and spending so much time figuring things out\non my own — instead of asking for help. In short, I was avoiding being\nvulnerable at all costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what I was actually doing was limiting the connections and trust I could\nbuild with my team, and with the effort required to hide from feeling\nvulnerable, I was also running myself straight toward burnout. Eventually, I\nrealized something needed to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-7.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 7\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround this time, I came across Dr. Brené Brown, and her amazing TED Talk about\nthe\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability/c\"\u003ePower of Vulnerability\u003c/a\u003e\n(if you haven't watched it yet I recommend that you do!). After watching that, I\nread her book Daring Greatly. And what she had to say fundamentally changed the\nway that I think about vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrené Brown defines vulnerability as \"uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure.\"\nWhich I thought, great! That totally aligns with my views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-8.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 8\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she also says, \"vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy,\ncourage, empathy, and creativity,\" and that it's the root of building authentic\nand meaningful connections. Now that didn't quite fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe'll skip ahead a bit here, but with a lot of reflection, reading, and let's be\nhonest here — therapy. I learned that you can't avoid ever feeling vulnerable,\nwithout shutting yourself out from all the great things vulnerability opens the\ndoors to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-9.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 9\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, just because we know that being vulnerable is \"good for you\" doesn't mean\nthat the feeling of discomfort immediately disappears. It takes a lot of effort\nand practice to sit with that discomfort and work through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-10.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 10\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that has helped me is to reframe my anxiety and nerves as excitement\nand an indication that whatever I'm nervous about is an opportunity for growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example. Speaking in front of a large, live audience? That could be pretty\nnerve-wracking, but the body sensations of anxiety and nervousness align pretty\nclosely with how it feels to be excited about something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, here I am, being vulnerable and really excited to be speaking in front of\nall of you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-11.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 11\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere's a common misconception about vulnerability — we think that to be\nvulnerable, we need to disclose absolutely everything, divulge every aspect of\nour personal lives, and lay everything out on the table. But that's not true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-12.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 12\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVulnerability without boundaries is simply not vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s use a theoretical example. Say you’re a senior leader, and your team is\ncoming to you expressing concerns about the stability of the tech industry.\nSounds familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo imagine you say: “I’m going to be vulnerable. I’m freaking out. I’ve never\nexperienced a downturn like this and I’m scared we’re all going to get\nlaid-off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo while your feelings are valid — saying it like that is unfair and likely\ngoing to scare your team. If you genuinely do feel that way, you should\nabsolutely share it with someone — but probably not the people that are looking\nto you as a source of stability and guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead you can say: “Your concerns are totally valid, and I feel a similar way.\nI’ve never been through something like this before. If you’re feeling\noverwhelmed I’m happy to talk more one on one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVulnerability is not about oversharing or dumping your feelings on someone. We\nhave to think about why we’re sharing and, equally as important, with whom. Ask\nyourself: Is this sharing appropriate, and will it move your work, connection or\nrelationship forward? Or is it just going to make you feel better in the\nshort-term?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-13.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 13\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo hopefully, I've convinced you, and you're ready to go forth and practice\nvulnerability. I'll share some strategies and tips to get you started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to come up with a nice acronym, but the best I have for you is this…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-14.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 14\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eASDF\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-15.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 15\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdmit\u003c/strong\u003e what you don't know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you pretend like you know everything, you're closing the door to curiosity\nand continuous learning and signalling to your team that perfection is expected.\nBeing vulnerable means we ask questions when we don't know something, we ask for\nhelp when we need it, we say no when something doesn’t fit with our time,\nenergy, or values, we ask for and listen to feedback, and we don't blame people\nwhen a mistake is made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay your team uses an acronym all the time. In theory you know what it means,\nbut you don’t actually know what the acronym stands for. You can go on\ncontinuing to not know, or you can ask, what does “DAG” stand for? Turns out a\ncouple people on your team also didn’t know what it stood for, and didn’t feel\ncomfortable enough to ask. It stands for Directed Acyclic Graph by the way. You\nasking what it means, normalizes asking questions and creates the space for\nothers on your team to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-16.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 16\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShare\u003c/strong\u003e when you are struggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's okay to talk to people about things you're struggling with, whether it’s a\nspecific project, a personal issue, or something else. It's important to be\nhonest about what you're going through, and like I already mentioned, you can do\nthis while respecting your boundaries and not disclosing every detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, you have something happening in your personal life that’s making it\ndifficult for you to focus. Instead of suffering in silence and having it\nnegatively impact your work, you can have the courage to be vulnerable and talk\nto your team and say “hey, I’ve got something going on in my life that I’m\nstruggling with and I wanted you to know. I’ll check in with you if I need help,\nbut I may need to take some time off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-17.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 17\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDevelop\u003c/strong\u003e an awareness of how vulnerability feels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllow yourself to really feel your emotions and check in with yourself.\nEventually, you'll become more comfortable with vulnerability and more easily\nrecognize how it feels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-18.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 18\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFind a friend\u003c/strong\u003e to practice with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing vulnerable can be intimidating, so the best advice I can give you is to\npractice vulnerability with someone you already trust. This could be your\nmanager, a mentor, a peer or a friend. We need to trust to be vulnerable, and we\nneed to be vulnerable to build trust. Often it feels like a leap of faith, being\nthe first to be vulnerable. But the more you practice vulnerability, the more\ncomfortable you will become with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-19.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 19\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d like to leave you with this quote by Brené Brown (she’s the best!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust is earned, not through heroic deeds, or even highly visible actions, but\nthrough paying attention, listening, and gestures of genuine care and\nconnection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs leaders, showing that you can be vulnerable at work gives others the\npermission to open up and be vulnerable too, ultimately creating a\npsychologically safer space for our teams.
