But the vulnerability you demonstrate by doing these things is precisely\nwhat makes a great leader.</p>\n<p>There is a fear that vulnerability will be seen as weakness, when it's actually\nthe root of building authentic and meaningful connections. Once you can push\npast the discomfort, being vulnerable at work opens the door to creativity,\ninnovation, and trust with your team.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I share my personal journey with vulnerability, as I learned to\nreframe my discomfort as opportunities for growth and eventually find the\ncourage to be vulnerable.</p>\n<h2>Slides</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 1\"></p>\n<p>As leaders in engineering, we all share some common goals. We want to focus on\nhigh-impact work and build the trust and influence required to get it done. We\nwant people to feel comfortable coming to us with their problems and ideas,\nasking questions, and sharing their honest opinions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 1\"></p>\n<p>And ultimately, we want our teams to be happy and <em>insert your OKR here</em>.</p>\n<p>That sounds all well and good, but realistically, so many things get in the way\nand make it harder for us to accomplish our goals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-3.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 3\"></p>\n<p>Maybe you've noticed that your team doesn't ask for help. Or recognized that it\ntakes a long time for concerns to be raised if they‚Äôre even brought up at all.\nOr maybe you've been told that other developers find you intimidating, and they\ndon‚Äôt feel like they can disagree with you.</p>\n<p>What all these things point to is a lack of trust and psychological safety. We\ncan‚Äôt accomplish our goals without creating a psychologically safe space for our\nteams.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 4\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/\">Extensive research</a>\nshows how psychological safety ‚Äî team members feeling safe enough to take risks\nand be vulnerable in front of each other ‚Äî is the most important dynamic that\nsets high-performing teams apart.</p>\n<p>Okay. So now, you might be looking at me and thinking ‚Äî hey Christina, I'm just\none person; how can I actually do anything about this?</p>\n<p>And I get it. It's easy to brush off these problems and dismiss them as\norganizational or cultural issues that are too hard to fix alone. But as leaders\nand role models, we have the power and privilege to create the environment and\nculture we want.</p>\n<p>So, how do we do that? How do we create an environment where our teams feel\nsafe? As you've probably guessed, we need to lead by example and lead with\nvulnerability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-5.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 5\"></p>\n<p>If your initial reaction to hearing that is, \"oh wow, absolutely no,\" you're not\nalone. Vulnerability in the workplace can make us feel uncomfortable, like we‚Äôre\nletting our guard down.</p>\n<p>I had been taught and believed that I always needed to be professional. I needed\nto maintain my distance and always project a confident and composed image;\notherwise, people wouldn't take me seriously.</p>\n<p>I was so afraid to show any vulnerability that whenever I was starting to feel a\nlittle bit vulnerable, I also felt immense shame, like I was letting my image\nslip and that people would \"find out\" about the real me. This fear and shame\ncrept up whenever I started something new, needed to ask a question, made a\nmistake, or struggled to balance work and my personal life. I didn't see other\npeople openly talk about these things, so I believed that if I did it myself, I\nwould be seen as weak or like I didn't deserve to be here.</p>\n<p>In my mind, being vulnerable would undermine my efforts to be respected, relied\non, and trusted. So I kept my guard up instead.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-6.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 6\"></p>\n<p>For me, this looked like forcing myself to give 110% at work every single day ‚Äî\nno matter what was going on in my personal life, never making a mistake ‚Äî and\nbeating myself up if I ever did, and spending so much time figuring things out\non my own ‚Äî instead of asking for help. In short, I was avoiding being\nvulnerable at all costs.</p>\n<p>But what I was actually doing was limiting the connections and trust I could\nbuild with my team, and with the effort required to hide from feeling\nvulnerable, I was also running myself straight toward burnout. Eventually, I\nrealized something needed to change.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-7.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 7\"></p>\n<p>Around this time, I came across Dr. Bren√© Brown, and her amazing TED Talk about\nthe\n<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability/c\">Power of Vulnerability</a>\n(if you haven't watched it yet I recommend that you do!). After watching that, I\nread her book Daring Greatly. And what she had to say fundamentally changed the\nway that I think about vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Bren√© Brown defines vulnerability as \"uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure.\"\nWhich I thought, great! That totally aligns with my views.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-8.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 8\"></p>\n<p>But she also says, \"vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy,\ncourage, empathy, and creativity,\" and that it's the root of building authentic\nand meaningful connections. Now that didn't quite fit.</p>\n<p>We'll skip ahead a bit here, but with a lot of reflection, reading, and let's be\nhonest here ‚Äî therapy. I learned that you can't avoid ever feeling vulnerable,\nwithout shutting yourself out from all the great things vulnerability opens the\ndoors to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-9.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 9\"></p>\n<p>Now, just because we know that being vulnerable is \"good for you\" doesn't mean\nthat the feeling of discomfort immediately disappears. It takes a lot of effort\nand practice to sit with that discomfort and work through it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-10.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 10\"></p>\n<p>Something that has helped me is to reframe my anxiety and nerves as excitement\nand an indication that whatever I'm nervous about is an opportunity for growth.</p>\n<p>For example. Speaking in front of a large, live audience? That could be pretty\nnerve-wracking, but the body sensations of anxiety and nervousness align pretty\nclosely with how it feels to be excited about something.</p>\n<p>So, here I am, being vulnerable and really excited to be speaking in front of\nall of you!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-11.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 11\"></p>\n<p>There's a common misconception about vulnerability ‚Äî we think that to be\nvulnerable, we need to disclose absolutely everything, divulge every aspect of\nour personal lives, and lay everything out on the table. But that's not true.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-12.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 12\"></p>\n<p>Vulnerability without boundaries is simply not vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs use a theoretical example. Say you‚Äôre a senior leader, and your team is\ncoming to you expressing concerns about the stability of the tech industry.\nSounds familiar.</p>\n<p>So imagine you say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be vulnerable. I‚Äôm freaking out. I‚Äôve never\nexperienced a downturn like this and I‚Äôm scared we‚Äôre all going to get\nlaid-off.‚Äù</p>\n<p>So while your feelings are valid ‚Äî saying it like that is unfair and likely\ngoing to scare your team. If you genuinely do feel that way, you should\nabsolutely share it with someone ‚Äî but probably not the people that are looking\nto you as a source of stability and guidance.</p>\n<p>Instead you can say: ‚ÄúYour concerns are totally valid, and I feel a similar way.\nI‚Äôve never been through something like this before. If you‚Äôre feeling\noverwhelmed I‚Äôm happy to talk more one on one.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Vulnerability is not about oversharing or dumping your feelings on someone. We\nhave to think about why we‚Äôre sharing and, equally as important, with whom. Ask\nyourself: Is this sharing appropriate, and will it move your work, connection or\nrelationship forward? Or is it just going to make you feel better in the\nshort-term?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-13.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 13\"></p>\n<p>So hopefully, I've convinced you, and you're ready to go forth and practice\nvulnerability. I'll share some strategies and tips to get you started.</p>\n<p>I tried to come up with a nice acronym, but the best I have for you is this‚Ä¶</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-14.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 14\"></p>\n<p>ASDF</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-15.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 15\"></p>\n<p><strong>Admit</strong> what you don't know.</p>\n<p>If you pretend like you know everything, you're closing the door to curiosity\nand continuous learning and signalling to your team that perfection is expected.\nBeing vulnerable means we ask questions when we don't know something, we ask for\nhelp when we need it, we say no when something doesn‚Äôt fit with our time,\nenergy, or values, we ask for and listen to feedback, and we don't blame people\nwhen a mistake is made.</p>\n<p>Say your team uses an acronym all the time. In theory you know what it means,\nbut you don‚Äôt actually know what the acronym stands for. You can go on\ncontinuing to not know, or you can ask, what does ‚ÄúDAG‚Äù stand for? Turns out a\ncouple people on your team also didn‚Äôt know what it stood for, and didn‚Äôt feel\ncomfortable enough to ask. It stands for Directed Acyclic Graph by the way. You\nasking what it means, normalizes asking questions and creates the space for\nothers on your team to do the same.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-16.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 16\"></p>\n<p><strong>Share</strong> when you are struggling.</p>\n<p>It's okay to talk to people about things you're struggling with, whether it‚Äôs a\nspecific project, a personal issue, or something else. It's important to be\nhonest about what you're going through, and like I already mentioned, you can do\nthis while respecting your boundaries and not disclosing every detail.</p>\n<p>For example, you have something happening in your personal life that‚Äôs making it\ndifficult for you to focus. Instead of suffering in silence and having it\nnegatively impact your work, you can have the courage to be vulnerable and talk\nto your team and say ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôve got something going on in my life that I‚Äôm\nstruggling with and I wanted you to know. I‚Äôll check in with you if I need help,\nbut I may need to take some time off.‚Äù</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-17.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 17\"></p>\n<p><strong>Develop</strong> an awareness of how vulnerability feels.</p>\n<p>Allow yourself to really feel your emotions and check in with yourself.\nEventually, you'll become more comfortable with vulnerability and more easily\nrecognize how it feels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-18.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 18\"></p>\n<p><strong>Find a friend</strong> to practice with.</p>\n<p>Being vulnerable can be intimidating, so the best advice I can give you is to\npractice vulnerability with someone you already trust. This could be your\nmanager, a mentor, a peer or a friend. We need to trust to be vulnerable, and we\nneed to be vulnerable to build trust. Often it feels like a leap of faith, being\nthe first to be vulnerable. But the more you practice vulnerability, the more\ncomfortable you will become with it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-19.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 19\"></p>\n<p>I‚Äôd like to leave you with this quote by Bren√© Brown (she‚Äôs the best!)</p>\n<p>\"Trust is earned, not through heroic deeds, or even highly visible actions, but\nthrough paying attention, listening, and gestures of genuine care and\nconnection.\"</p>\n<p>As leaders, showing that you can be vulnerable at work gives others the\npermission to open up and be vulnerable too, ultimately creating a\npsychologically safer space for our teams. If we want to foster healthy debate,\nfor people to share their ideas, seek feedback, and ask for help, we need to\nlead by example and lead with vulnerability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/blog/vulnerability/vulnerability-slide-20.jpeg\" alt=\"Leading With Vulnerability, Slide 20\"></p>\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/vulnerability/cover.jpeg"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
